                Lower Lights Leadership Academy is a voluntary association of homeschool families engaged in the pursuit of a Leadership Education. Families meet together each Thursday to participate in Junior School classes, Scholar Projects, and Parent Program classes. At Lower Lights we supplement and enhance what takes place in the home. Our aim is to use our time together to inspire students to become self-directed learners who take ownership of their education.
