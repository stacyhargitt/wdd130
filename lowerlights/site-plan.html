        Vision and Mission
          Lower Lights Leadership Academy is a voluntary association of homeschool families engaged in the pursuit of a Leadership Education. Families meet together each Thursday to participate in Junior School classes, Scholar Projects, and Parent Program classes. At Lower Lights we supplement and enhance what takes place in the home. Our aim is to use our time together to inspire students to become self-directed learners who take ownership of their education.

            A Leadership Education
              Is family-based and agency-driven
              Utilizes mentors, classics, and the study of principles to develop an individual’s unique genius
              Is hard work and so much fun

          Sword and Hero
            Age Recommendation: 13-14+
            In Sword of Freedom and the Hero Project, we learn about the vital principles of freedom, seeing multiple sides of issues and resolving conflict, leadership, and public virtue as we discuss the purpose of government, world crisis and personal and family choices, war, pestilence, betrayal, statesmanship, hardship, how to survive during difficult times, and true heroes. 
            These studies in the Civil War and World War II will give your scholar an understanding of the complexity of the times as the US was drawn into a war and an astounding number of conflicts and crises. Even more importantly, they may be inspired to find the hero within themselves and invaluable lessons they can apply now and in the future.

          Classical Acting
            (Advanced High School Theater)
            For high schoolers (and 8th graders) who have taken Shakespeare Conquest and are ready for the next step in their acting experience.
            This advanced theater class will include reading/discussing theater classics from several different time periods. Ancient Greece (Oedipus), French Farce (by Moliere), Modern classics (Our Town), and of course, Shakespeare. 
            In addition to reading and discussing the plays, scholars will be performing! They will perform individual scenes first semester (parents are invited to our showcase) and second semester will include a process drama (a rewritten, shortened version of a SHakespeare Tragedy directed and produced by the student scholars) and a complete Shakespere comedy (though shortened) to be performed at local elementary and middle schools (a traveling troupe) - as well as a public performance.
            Each class period will include acting improvisation games/practice, short lectures on acting tools/ methods, student presentations on information pertaining to the theater classic we are studying, student performances (singing, acting, speaking - whatever they want to share) and of course our colloquia on classic literature.

          The Food Class
            Food can be sacred.
            Food can be a weapon.
            Food can be political.
            Food can be medicine.
              What is this class about?
              [Food. Obviously.]
            We are going in on the cultural traditions of food, the history of food in our country and in the world. We are also going to do a unit on nutrition and healthy living, with a focus on scholars being intentional about how they decide they want to take care of their bodies.
            There will be an introduction of myriad food perspectives and philosophies.
            There will be outside reading and watching assignments (food documentaries, etc).
            There will be scholar presentations that will have these kids researching ac culture, interviewing an individual from that country (contact information will be provided), and preparing an authentic meal for the class.
            This is going to be epic.
            Recommended age group: 13+

          Quest 3
            Worldviews: learn to see the world through 5 different worldviews and understand how other people in our nation and in our world see reality, humanity, the role of government, the basis of laws, and many, many other things.
            Self-governance: learn to effectively lead themselves, influence, engage and collaborate with others and continuously improve and renew their capabilities.
            Governing a nation: learn and memorize 28 principles of good government and apply them to current events.
            Jurisprudence: understand the theory of law through the study of two supreme court cases by writing legal briefs and arguing before a moot court.
