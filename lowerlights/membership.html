                FAQ
            </h2>
            <p>
                Q: When and where do you meet?<br>
                A: Thursdays 9-1pm for Junior classes and some Scholar classes, see enrichment classes for specific class times. We meet at 4300 W 16th St.<br><br>

                Q: Is teaching a class a requirement for membership?<br>
                A: At this time, we ask all parents to teach a class if possible. There are always other ways to help. If you would not like a permanent teaching position, there is an opportunity to teach in the Junior School for a week or two on a specific subject of your choice to enrich the Junior School classes. Each parent brings a unique, valuable dynamic to the co-op that benefits our children. Homeschooling parents are more than equipped to teach a class, you donâ€™t need a degree. <br><br>

                Q: Is this a drop-off program?<br>
                A: No, parent participation is an important part of co-op. Lower Lights is a volunteer-run organization and all members are expected to fulfill volunteer roles throughout the day. Parents are still responsible for their children and their discipline throughout the co-op day. Also, we find parents realize the same benefits from co-op as their children: community, friendships and fun!
