                Age Recommendation: 13-14+<br>
                In Sword of Freedom and the Hero Project, we learn about the vital principles of freedom, seeing multiple sides of issues and resolving conflict, leadership, and public virtue as we discuss the purpose of government, world crisis and personal and family choices, war, pestilence, betrayal, statesmanship, hardship, how to survive during difficult times, and true heroes. <br>
                These studies in the Civil War and World War II will give your scholar an understanding of the complexity of the times as the US was drawn into a war and an astounding number of conflicts and crises. Even more importantly, they may be inspired to find the hero within themselves and invaluable lessons they can apply now and in the future.
